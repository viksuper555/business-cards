# Business Card AR App

This is a Unity-based augmented reality (AR) application that enhances business cards by displaying relevant metadata in real-time.

## Features

- **Customizable Information**: Easily update the metadata shown for each card. 
- **AR Metadata Overlay**: Detects business cards and displays associated metadata next to them. (Requires internet)

## Plans
- **Basic**: Show phone number and LinkedIn.

## How It Works

1. **Detection**: The app uses the device's camera to detect business cards.
2. **Metadata Retrieval**: Once a card is detected, the app retrieves the associated metadata for the specific plan from a data json file stored in this repository.
3. **Display**: The metadata is displayed next to the business card in AR, providing a seamless view of additional information.
